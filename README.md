This is the elliptic motion version.

uniform (probably not so uniform because it supports linear acceleration) circular motion demo page with auto div scaling!

Some special points to point:

* The size of the container (which contains balls) will change based on the change of the window size while the ball preserves its semi-X-axis and semi-Y-axis (or radius) of circular motion. If the ball hits the boundary it will stop.
* The layout is optimized(?) for the screen size of the device.
* The `X-axis` and `Y-axis` are un-settable. Instead the offset can be set by dragging the ball.
* When reset, the semi-X-axis and semi-Y-axis of circular motion is set default to half of the container length.
* If the semi-X-axis or semi-Y-axis changes when the ball is in motion, the text in the `semi-X-axis(px)` or `semi-Y-axis(px)` box does not change; but when the user clicks the text box, it changes to the newest value. Same for period.
* `one-click` options are hidden if there is only one ball present.
